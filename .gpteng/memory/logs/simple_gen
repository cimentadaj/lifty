Additional Notes:\n\n    Use Django's templating engine to render data.\n    For displaying avatars, consider using Django's ImageField.\n    Make use of Django's CHOICES for fields like status.\n    Utilize CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS to style the elements and make the page responsive.\n    JavaScript can be employed for dynamic elements like the search functionality.\n\n\n\nOnce you implement all the code, be sure to leave everything that I need to execute in the run.sh file.
